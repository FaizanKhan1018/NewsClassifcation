Introduction
News classification is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to automatically categorize a given news article into predefined categories such as sports, technology, politics, and more. In this project, we use the TF-IDF technique to convert textual news data into numerical feature vectors, which are then used to train classification models.

The primary models used for classification include:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
These models are trained on the transformed news articles and then evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of news articles, each labeled with a corresponding category. The dataset contains articles related to the following categories (example):

Politics
Sports
Business
Technology
Entertainment
Health
Example Format:
Article Text	Category
"The stock market hit an all-time high today..."	Business
"The sports team won the championship..."	Sports
"A breakthrough in AI was announced by..."	Technology
Source of Dataset: Public news datasets from Kaggle or any other news article source.

TF-IDF Vectorization
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection (or corpus) of documents. In this project, TF-IDF is used to convert text articles into feature vectors that can be fed into machine learning models for classification.

TF-IDF Process:
Term Frequency (TF): The number of times a term appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): How rare or common a word is across all documents.
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Combines TF and IDF to create a weighted score that reflects the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize the vectorizer
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)

# Fit and transform the text data into TF-IDF feature vectors
X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test)
Model Selection
We experiment with multiple machine learning models to find the best classifier for this task. The models considered include:

Logistic Regression: A linear model that is commonly used for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that separates the data by finding the optimal hyperplane.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
Logistic Regression Example:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize and train the model
lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
Support Vector Machine Example:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize and train the model
svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear')
svm_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
Random Forest Classifier Example:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize and train the model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified samples.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positive samples.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Example Evaluation Code:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
